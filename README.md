# Quantum Computers

Particle game on IBM's quantum computers as part of U. Porto's quantum computation group.

We were learning with the qiskit textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html

We would also recreate popular algorithms and papers. Currently, Qiskit also has many youtube tutorials you can watch and learn from that. Some algorithms we can try to recreate:
- Deutsch Josza algorithm
- Grover algorithm
- Shor algorithm
- Fast Fourier Transform algorithm
- Simon algorithm
- Boson Sampling Problem algorithm
- Solving linear systems of equations
- etc...
