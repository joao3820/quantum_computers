# Quantum Computers

Particle game on IBM's quantum computers as part of U. Porto's quantum computation group.

We were learning with the qiskit textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html

We would also recreate popular algorithms and papers. Currently, Qiskit also has many youtube tutorials you can watch and learn from that. Some algorithms we can try to recreate:
- Deutsch Josza algorithm
- Grover algorithm
- Shor algorithm
- Fast Fourier Transform algorithm
- Simon algorithm
- Boson Sampling Problem algorithm
- Solving linear systems of equations
- etc...

Somthing to note about quantum algorithms is that we use a lot the word "circuit", which is weird, because it would normally refer to something ciclic, but not in this case. Here, the information travels from left to right on our schematics. To a "black box" we call "oracle". Also, when entanglement exists, we call that unit e-bit. And a quantum register is a system comprising multiple qubits.
